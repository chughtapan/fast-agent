⏺ PR #1330 in modelcontextprotocol/servers is closed. It was a documentation PR to add the Scrapeless MCP Server to the README. The PR was closed on July 18, 2025 by @olaservo because changes were requested but not addressed for an extended period. The submitter can
   reopen if they still want to update and merge the PR.

> Why did you choose the servers repository?

⏺ You're right to question that. I assumed you meant the "servers" repository because it's the most commonly referenced repo in the modelcontextprotocol organization, but I should have checked which repository actually has issue #1330.

  Let me search for the correct repository:

⏺ You caught that! I initially checked the "servers" repository because that's a common one, but you're asking about issue #1330 in the "modelcontextprotocol" repository itself.

  This issue is open and is a Standards Enhancement Proposal (SEP-1330) about improving enum schema definitions for MCP elicitation. It's currently in review status and proposes:

  1. Deprecating the non-standard enumNames property
  2. Introducing JSON Schema-compliant patterns using oneOf for single-select and anyOf for multi-select enums
  3. Supporting both titled and untitled enum varieties
  4. Extending ElicitResult to support string arrays for multi-select responses

  The proposal is authored by Cliff Hall and yourself (Tapan Chugh), includes reference implementations, and was last updated on August 25, 2025. It's currently assigned to Cliff Hall for review.
